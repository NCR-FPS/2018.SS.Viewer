A series of benchmarks have been developed by DFO Science to determine what management category (Healthy, Cautious, Critical, Undetermined) a stock falls under. Each management category has specific management actions to ensure sustainability and/or the recovery of a stock. The following are each management category with its associated management actions that play into Dolly Varden's strategy to control exploitation. 
Healthy: 5% removal rate, based on the most recent stock size estimate; Voluntary harvest management; Only general legislative requirements and sport fishing limits apply.
Cautious: Less than 5% removal rate, based on the most recent stock size estimate; Promote rebuilding of the stock through education and specific management measures; Voluntary harvest management; Only general legislative requirements and sport fishing limits apply; Maintain regular stock assessments to determine population status and trends.
Critical: No targeted harvest; Harvest closures in regulations; Promote rebuilding of the stock through education and specific management measures; Maintain regular stock assessments to determine population status and trends.
Undetermined: Maintain regular stock assessments to determine population status and trend; Less than 5% removal rate; Promote rebuilding of the stock if required through education and specific management measures; Voluntary harvest management; Only general legislative requirements and sport fishing limits apply. 
Other management measures that have been implemented to all management categories are as follows:

The TAC should be set to mitigate declines and, when possible, promote positive change in SSN over a three-year period when it is below the USR. A harvest strategy of FREF is acceptable when the stock is in the Cautious zone, so long as the first criterion is met; however, it is required that fishing mortality will decline as the stock progresses lower into the Cautious Zone. The management response will vary depending on location of the stock within the cautious Zone, whether the stock is increasing or decreasing, whether the trajectory (growth or decline) is projected to continue, and indications of incoming recruitment to the SSB, for example.

When the SSN is below the LRP, the harvest strategy is to be results-driven rather than based on a predetermined harvest rate.

Keep fishing mortality of 4X5Y haddock moderate by using the following references and risk tolerances: •The TAC may be set with a low to neutral (50%) probability of exceeding the fishing mortality target reference (FREF) when it is above the LRP.
•The TAC may be set with a low (less than 25%) probability of exceeding the fishing mortality limit reference (FLIM) when the SSB is above the USR.
•The TAC should be set to mitigate declines and, when possible, promote positive change in spawning stock biomass (SSB) over a three-year period when it is below the upper stock reference (USR). The management response will vary depending on location of the stock within the Cautious zone, whether the stock is increasing or decreasing, whether the trajectory (growth or decline) is projected to continue, and indications of incoming recruitment to the SSB, for example. As such, the TAC may be set with a higher probability of exceeding FREF when the stock is in the upper part of the Cautious zone and expected to increase, while fishing mortality must be decreased as the stock progresses lower into the Cautious zone.
•When the SSB is below the limit reference point (LRP), the harvest strategy is to be results-driven rather than based on a predetermined harvest rate. Rebuilding to a level above the LRP should be achieved in a reasonable timeframe (1.5 to 2 generations) with a high degree of probability (greater than 75%).

•	The Lower Limit Reference point(LRP) for this fishery is 255 tonnes.
•	No harvest will be allowed if the biomass falls below the LRP of 255 tonnes.
•	Last year the TAC for the commercial fishery was set for 403 395pounds.   
•	This was determined with a pre-season biomass estimate of 846 t.  Using a 22% Harvest rate and setting aside 6000lbs for the traditional Food Social and Ceremonial catch and 1000 lbs for Recreational catch. 
•	The total Catch for 2018/19  was 61 000 lbs most of which was dug in the early part of the season.   

While the assessed biomass is still above the LRP of 255 tonnes,  the cooperative Management Body consisting of the CHN and DFO  are implementing  a precautionary approach for the 2019 season. :

a. Closure of the Commercial Fishery for the 2019 season. 
b. Reduction in the bag limit for Recreation catch  for the 2019- 20 season to a daily limit of 25 clams and a total possession limit of 50 clams.   (*currently the bag limit is: a daily limit of 50 clams and a total possession limit of 100 clams.)"

It is important to distinguish between ""harvest rate"" which reflects the fraction of removals relative to the available biomass, and the harvest level, which does not have a clear definition but appears to refer to quota taken relative to the quota that was set. The harvest rate reference for BC is 21% and the harvest rate is estimated to have been above this rate for several years. This is due to a complex set of circumstances that include retrospective bias in the stock assessment model (i.e., the model downgrades its estimate of previous stock size every time a new year of data is added), and the decision-making process, which takes into account risk to the stock as well as social and economic risk."

Following the extirpation of sea otters from BC, the abundance of prey species increased substantially and current red sea urchin populations are considered to be at artificially high levels. Red Sea Urchin overabundances (barrens) exist in numerous locations in BC and have a negative impact on ecosystem function by limiting the growth of kelp and sessile invertebrates. 
It is believed that red sea urchin populations are far more impacted by natural predation than commercial harvesting and that historical equilibrium populations were low. Furthermore, only urchins with the highest quality gonads are harvested which leaves a natural reserve of animals that remain after commercial harvest that consists of urchins smaller than the minimum size limit, urchins that are too large, urchins at deeper than diveable depths and urchins with poor quality gonads. Since fecundity increases with size in urchins, the individuals with the greatest reproductive capacity are consistently left behind by harvesters.

The time, money and effort required to survey all sea cucumber harvest areas in BC multiple times would be prohibitive. So reference points are of limited use for sea cucumber management at this time. Commercial no-take reserves have been implemented in this fishery as an alternative to reference points. These reserves are closed to commercial harvest, placed all over the coast and are meant to provide insurance against uncertainties in stock assessment or management and to hopefully provide spillover of adults and larvae into surrounding commercial harvest areas."

While many salmon fisheries being evaluated harvest a mix of salmon conservation units, Section 1 on stock status for the fishery has been evaluated based on the fishery reference points and harvest decision rules designed to control exploitation identified in the relevant salmon IFMP. As a result , this checklist does not report on the Wild Salmon Policy integrated status of individual conservation units (2) in the fishery."

Excerpt from the next scientific opinion to be published (EVALUATION OF CRABE STOCKS FROM THE SNOW OF THE ESTUARY AND NORTHERN GULF OF THE SAINT-LAURENT (ZONES 13 to 17, 12A, 12B, 12C and 16A) IN 2018) :

Perspectives for each area include three possible scenarios for setting the 2019 TAC. These are established taking into account the value and uncertainty of a combined indicator (consisting of the commercial catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and the number per unit of effort (NUE) of the post-season scientific survey) and related indicators (crab shell size and condition, expected recruitment) of the stock status, with the objective of sustainable resource management. The characteristics of each scenario are as follows:
1) Upper Scenario
- higher probability of higher operating intensity for the upcoming season

Excerpt from the next scientific opinion to be published (EVALUATION OF CRABE STOCKS FROM THE SNOW OF THE ESTUARY AND NORTHERN GULF OF THE SAINT-LAURENT (ZONES 13 to 17, 12A, 12B, 12C and 16A) IN 2018) :

Perspectives for each area include three possible scenarios for setting the 2019 TAC. These are established taking into account the value and uncertainty of a combined indicator (consisting of the commercial catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and the number per unit of effort (NUE) of the post-season scientific survey) and related indicators (crab shell size and condition, expected recruitment) of the stock status, with the objective of sustainable resource management. The characteristics of each scenario are as follows:
1) Upper Scenario
- higher probability of higher operating intensity for the upcoming season 
- level of harvesting that may result in fishing mortality above the historical average 
- sampling pressure that may not be sustainable in the long term and, 
- likely decrease in abundance compared to the previous year if recruitment is relatively stable or decreasing
2) Intermediate scenario
- probability that the operating intensity will be moderate for the coming season, similar to the previous season 
- assumed harvest level to maintain fishing mortality close to the historical average
- could maintain the stock at a level of abundance similar to the previous year 
3) Lower scenario
- higher probability that the exploitation intensity will be lower for the upcoming fishing season than the previous one
- assumed conservative harvest level resulting in fishing mortality below the historical average 
- could lead to an increase in stock abundance over the previous year or to the maintenance of existing biomass over a longer period of time.",Harvest rate/level at or below removal reference,,,,,,N/A,No,,Uncertain,"Yes, Up to Date","Snow crab - Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence Inshore Areas (12A, 12B, 12C, 13, 14, 15, 16, 16A and 17)","Yes, Full IFMP",http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/ifmp-gmp/snow-crab-neige/2019/snow-crab-neiges-eng.html,No,No,,,,No,,,,,No,,,,,Yes,No,Yes,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,"The measurements are published online: https://inter-l01.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/applications/opti-opei/notice-avis-detail-eng.php?pub_id=1552&todo=view&type=1&region_id=4&sub_type_id=5&species=705&area=1845
